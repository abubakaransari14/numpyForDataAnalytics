# numpyForDataAnalytics
In this repo i will upload 50 practice question for numpy basically i am doing a numpy practice easy to hard and more even harder, the goal is to be prepare for the data science or Machine Learning, i will do my best until i achieve and the rest i will left in the hand of God!
These 50 problems may cover almost every NumPy concept needed for data analytics, data science, and interviews
